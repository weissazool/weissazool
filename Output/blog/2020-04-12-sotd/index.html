The previous weekend I had discovered that Heiwanomori park now has a turf multi-use field that is open to the public, with a few nets that I could throw into. Unfortunately, now that the state of emergency was in effect, that field was closed. They used to have a big grass field, but it's under renovation.</p><p>Frustrated and pressed for time, I found another park on the map and headed up to it in hopes of at least having some space to do my agility workout.</p><p>On the way, I passed by a couple of temples, of which this is one. I would have loved to explore a bit more, but I just took one shot of this gentleman walking in and moved on.</p></div><span>Tagged with: </span><ul class="tag-list"><li><a href="/tags/sotd">SOTD</a></li><li><a href="/tags/training">training</a></li></ul></article></div><footer><p>Generated using <a href="https://github.com/johnsundell/publish">Publish</a></p><p><a href="/feed.rss">RSS feed</a></p></footer></body></html>
